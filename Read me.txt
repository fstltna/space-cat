This action game requires you to have cat reflexes!

Your mission sounds simple - kill all the space mice using your intergalactic cannon,
However to make it through to the next level your reflexes alone won't do - 
you must also find the most efficient way to win without running out of ammo

Be mindful a well fed cat is a happy cat...

Enjoy :-)

The game is played using the mouse
